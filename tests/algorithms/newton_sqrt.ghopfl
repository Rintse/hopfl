# Estimates the sqrt of a given number using newtons method
# in an infitie approximation stream.
# Free variables to pass through the environment:
#   x:      The number to take the square root of
#   it:     The iteration to take from the stream
# Example run:
#   stack run ghopfl-exe -- -i tests/algorithms/newton_sqrt.ghopfl -E -e "x<-9;it<-6" -n 6

    approx_stream ← ( ( fix f . λ guess . 
        in ( guess, f ⊙ next ( update guess ) )
    ) x ) ; # Simply take x to be the initial guess
