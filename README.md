# GHOPFL
A interpreter for a guarded higher order probabilistic language (GHOPFL), 
based on the big-step, call-by-value semantics given in my thesis.

## Running the program
To execute the program use:
```
stack run ghopfl-exe -- [args]
```
Use the `-h` flag to get started.

## Tests
There are tests available in `tests/`. 
Each test has comments explaining its workings. 
Example runs are provided at the top of these test files.
